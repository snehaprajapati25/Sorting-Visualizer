# Sorting-Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web application built with React that allows users to visually experience how different sorting algorithms work. The app demonstrates the step-by-step process of sorting data using a variety of algorithms, providing an interactive and educational tool for understanding algorithmic behavior.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch as the algorithms sort data in real-time, with bars representing elements that change in size or color based on sorting actions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can choose the sorting algorithm, data set size, and sorting speed, and then start the sorting process with a click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Algorithms Supported

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- - **Heap Sort**


## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript framework used to build the user interface and manage app states.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making the user interface clean and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for implementing sorting algorithms and handling app logic.
